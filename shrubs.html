      <p>Plowing forward, brushing aside sharp broken branches and spiky leaves,
      you reach the clearing. You quickly glance around, as the darkening skies
      are even more evident the deeper you get in the forest. Suddenly you spy
      something red as cherry pie… it’s the signature bow of little Sweetie
      Blossom, huddling in some bushes, sobbing, trying to stay warm. You run
      over to her and exclaim, “why are you out here, Sweetie?” Sniffing, she
      tries to stand tall and say, “I just went out this morning to explore! I’m
      not a baby, I made it all the way up here, didn’t I? And I was doing fine,
      until this horrible sudden storm rolled in!” Knowing this isn’t a good time
      for lessons, you tell her to stick with you.</p>
